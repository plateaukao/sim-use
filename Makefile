# Pipe a swift invocation through xcsift (condensed, agent-friendly
# TOON output) when it is installed; fall back to swift's own output
# otherwise, so contributors are never required to install it. $(2)
# passes extra xcsift flags (e.g. --coverage). Knobs:
#   SIM_USE_XCSIFT=0        force plain swift output even with xcsift
#   SIM_USE_RAW_LOG=<path>  also save the raw swift output to <path>
#                           before condensing (CI keeps it as a
#                           failure artifact). Expanded unquoted on
#                           purpose: empty means tee has no file
#                           operand and acts as a plain passthrough.
# pipefail keeps swift's exit code authoritative either way.
