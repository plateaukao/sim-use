        Inspects the frontmost app's accessibility tree for characteristic
        software-keyboard buttons. Useful when an automation script needs
        to pick between the default Cmd+V paste path (requires a connected
        hardware keyboard) and the `sim-use paste --via-menu` touch path
        (works regardless of the hardware-keyboard toggle).

        Text output:
          soft     # software keyboard visible
          hidden   # no software keyboard detected

        Exit code reflects probe success, not visibility — `soft` and
        `hidden` both exit 0; non-zero is reserved for genuine failure
        (unreachable device, AX tree fetch error). Branch on stdout:
          if [[ "$(sim-use keyboard-state --udid X)" == soft ]]; then ...

        JSON output (--json):
          {"visible": true, "chromeKeyCount": 6, "letterKeyCount": 26,
           "idChromeCount": 7, "globeSeen": true}

        Visibility is the OR of four independent signals on Button
        descendants of the AX tree:
          * idChromeCount  >= 2  — locale-proof AXIdentifier in
                                   {shift, delete, return, Search, more,
                                   emoji, dictation, space} (primary)
          * globeSeen            — label hits the small Next-Keyboard set
                                   {Next Keyboard, 次のキーボード,
                                    下一个键盘, 下一個鍵盤, 다음 키보드}
          * letterKeyCount >= 10 — single Latin letter buttons (QWERTY)
          * chromeKeyCount >= 3  — localized chrome label whitelist
                                   (legacy fallback)
        Any single signal is enough; all four counters are surfaced for
        debugging misfires.
