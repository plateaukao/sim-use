Give AI agents the ability to observe and act on iOS Simulator, real iPhone / iPad, and Android emulator / device screens.

**Observe** — turn any screen into a token-efficient outline an LLM can reason about:

```text
$ sim-use ui
App: Settings  402x874

[Top  y<120]
  @1  StaticText  "Settings"
[Content  y=120..754]
  @5  SearchField  "Search"
  @7  Button  "Sign in to your iPhone"
  @9  Button  "General"
  @10 Button  "Display & Brightness"
  @11 Button  "Wallpaper"
  ...
[Bottom  y>754]
  @43 TabBar
```

**Act** — tap any element by its alias, no coordinates needed:

```text
$ sim-use tap @9
✓ Tap at (201.0, 452.0) completed successfully
```

Plan, code, **verify**, ship — teach this CLI to your agent and close the last gap in the agentic mobile development loop. Let agents verify what they built so you can focus on what matters.

`sim-use` is a cross-platform CLI that drives Apple's Accessibility APIs, the iOS Simulator HID pipeline, and Android's AccessibilityService through a single command surface. It emits a compact, agent-friendly screen description (`ui`) and an alias-cached tap shortcut (`tap @N`) so an LLM loop can observe → act in a few hundred milliseconds per round trip.

## The observe → act loop

Every interaction follows the same cycle — observe, act, verify:

```bash
sim-use ui                  # 1. read the screen
sim-use tap @9              # 2. act on what you see
sim-use ui                  # 3. verify the result
```

Multiple selector styles for different needs:

| Selector | Example | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `@N` alias | `tap @9` | Speed — cached from last `ui` |
| `#<id>` | `tap #settingsButton` | Stability — survives layout changes |
| `--label` | `tap --label "General"` | Scripted flows with `--wait-timeout` |
| `-x -y` / `--point` | `tap --point 100,200` | Last resort — no AX data |

AX-derived selectors work in any orientation: sim-use self-calibrates the
current rotation on each command and maps outline coordinates onto the
framebuffer before dispatching (iOS). Explicit `-x/-y`/`--point` is always
interpreted in the device-native portrait space.


## Why sim-use

- **Token-efficient.** The outline representation is ~16x more compact than a raw JSON accessibility tree. An LLM can read and reason about an entire screen in a few hundred tokens.
- **Nothing hidden.** sim-use walks the full accessibility tree including WebViews, system overlays, and embedded content — no elements are silently skipped.
- **AI-native.** Designed from day one for agent loops, not human testers. Alias-cached taps (`@N`), structured `--json` envelopes with actionable `hint` fields on errors, and a bundled agent skill (`sim-use init --client claude`) that teaches your AI client the full command surface.
- **Fast.** A per-device background daemon amortises init cost across calls. After the first command, each observe-act round trip completes in ~300 ms.
- **Cross-platform.** One command surface drives both iOS Simulator and Android emulator/device. Same verbs, same flags, same `--json` shape — write one agent loop that works on both.


## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap lycorp-jp/tap
brew install lycorp-jp/tap/sim-use
```

On Homebrew 6.0.5+, if you see an "untrusted tap" error, run `brew trust lycorp-jp/tap` first.

### Build from source

sim-use is a Swift package targeting **macOS 14+**, built with the latest Xcode toolchain. It links against static XCFrameworks built from [Meta's idb](https://github.com/facebook/idb), which are produced locally by the build script (they are large and not checked into the repository). The idb checkout generates its Xcode project with [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lycorp-jp/sim-use.git
cd sim-use

# Build the required XCFrameworks (first time only)
./scripts/build.sh dev

# Build sim-use itself
make build
.build/debug/sim-use --help

# Other Makefile targets
make test    # run tests
make clean
```

The XCFrameworks are built without library evolution, so their Swift
modules are locked to the toolchain that produced them — re-run
`./scripts/build.sh dev` after switching Xcode versions.

### Xcode 27 (beta) compatibility

sim-use fully supports Xcode 27 betas that ship `SimulatorKit.framework`
in `Contents/SharedFrameworks` (Beta 4 and later; Beta 1 shipped without
it), **including Device Hub workflows**:

- The HID transport is selected automatically per simulator boot: a
  simulator whose legacy HID was suppressed at boot (booted while Device
  Hub was open) is driven through dtuhidd's CoreDevice HID service, and
  everything else through the legacy SimulatorKit path. No reboot dance,
  no guard errors — `tap` / `type` / `swipe` work in both states.
- `SIM_USE_HID_TRANSPORT=indigo|dtuhid` forces a specific transport for
  debugging (combine with `SIM_USE_NO_DAEMON=1` — the per-UDID daemon
  keeps the environment it was first spawned with).
- Xcode 27 no longer bundles Simulator.app; the one from an Xcode 26.x
  install still works for viewing simulators, as does Device Hub itself.
- Work record: `docs/ai/xxxx-xcode27-support/README.md`.

### Agent skill

To install the bundled agent skill into your AI client's skill directory:

```bash
sim-use init                        # auto-detect installed clients
sim-use init --client claude        # non-interactive
sim-use init --dest ~/.claude/skills
sim-use init --print                # print skill content without installing
sim-use init --uninstall --client claude
```


## Platforms

sim-use drives **iOS Simulators**, **Android devices / emulators**, and **real iPhones / iPads** through the same command surface. The device ID shape decides which backend handles the call:

  * `1A2B3C4D-5E6F-...` (8-4-4-4-12 UUID) → iOS Simulator
  * `emulator-5554` / `R5CT1ABCD12` / `192.168.1.5:5555` → Android device
  * `00008150-000E242411D9401C` (8-16 hex, or 40 hex on pre-A12 hardware) → real iOS device

Each non-simulator platform needs a one-time bootstrap:

  * **Android** — `sim-use android init --device <serial>` installs the bridge APK. See `AGENTS.md` for toolchain setup.
  * **Real iOS device** — `sim-use ios-device init` builds and starts the on-device bridge. See [Real iOS devices](#real-ios-devices) below.



## Real iOS devices

sim-use drives a physical iPhone or iPad through an **on-device XCUITest bridge**
(`ios-bridge/`). Once it is running, the ordinary verbs work against the phone
exactly as they do against a simulator — same outline format, same `@N` aliases,
same `--json` envelopes:

```bash
sim-use ios-device init --team-id ABCDE12345   # build + start the bridge
sim-use devices                                # the phone now appears as `ios-device`

DEVICE=00008150-000E242411D9401C
sim-use ui   --device "$DEVICE"
sim-use tap  @3 --device "$DEVICE"
sim-use type "hello" --device "$DEVICE"
sim-use screenshot --device "$DEVICE"

sim-use ios-device stop                        # end the session
```

### How it differs from Android — and why

Android's bridge is a prebuilt APK you install once. iOS cannot work that way,
and the differences below all trace back to one platform fact: **iOS grants
cross-app accessibility and event injection only to a process `testmanagerd` is
supervising** — an XCUITest runner — and only for as long as its test method is
running. (WebDriverAgent exists for the same reason.)

  * **You must sign it yourself.** There is no universally-installable prebuilt
    runner; the bridge ships as source and `init` builds it with your Apple
    Development team. Pass `--team-id`, set `SIM_USE_IOS_TEAM_ID`, or have
    exactly one `Apple Development` identity in your keychain.
  * **The session is a live host process.** `init` leaves an `xcodebuild
    test-without-building` running; the bridge dies with it. `sim-use ios-device
    status` reports whether it is still up.
  * **The device must be unlocked** when `init` runs — iOS refuses to launch a
    test runner on a locked device. For long sessions set Auto-Lock to Never.
  * **Developer Mode must be on** (Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer
    Mode), and the Mac must be trusted.

### Requirements

Xcode 15+ (verified on Xcode 26 / iOS 27), an Apple Development signing
identity, and a paired device on USB or the same Wi-Fi network. USB is
preferred — sim-use reaches the phone through `usbmuxd` directly, with no port
forwarding to manage; Wi-Fi is used automatically when the device is not
plugged in.

### Verb coverage

Supported: `describe-ui` / `ui`, `tap`, `long-press` (including `--fingers 2`),
`swipe`, `gesture` (scroll / edge-swipe / pinch / rotate presets),
`multi-touch`, `touch` (atomic `--down --up` form only — the split form cannot
hold a touch open across invocations, same as Android), `type`, `screenshot`,
`keyboard-state`, `button` (home, lock, volume).

Live AX selectors (`--label`, `--id`, `--label-contains`, `--label-regex`,
`--value`, plus `--element-type` / `--frame` narrowing and `--wait-timeout`
polling) work on `tap` and `long-press`: each resolution fetches a **fresh**
accessibility snapshot and runs the same resolver the Simulator uses, so
nothing ever falls back to a stale cached frame. Budget for it — a snapshot
walk is 2–4 s on a real phone, per poll tick. The `@N` / `#N` outline aliases
remain the fast path.

`record-video` captures over **USB** via CoreMediaIO (the same route as
QuickTime's iPhone movie recording), so it works even without an `ios-device
init` session — but not over Wi-Fi; plug the cable in. The first run triggers
a one-time macOS camera permission prompt for your terminal (macOS treats iOS
screen capture as camera access). Frames arrive at the device's native
variable frame rate (`--fps` is ignored, as on Android); `--quality` maps to
bitrate and `--scale` to output size; rotating the device stops the recording
(an MP4 track cannot change frame size) and keeps the partial file.

`paste` is **best-effort** on real devices. It reliably puts text on the
device pasteboard, but whether the synthesized Cmd+V then runs a paste depends
on the surface: in ordinary apps the key events arrive on the text-input
stream as characters and never become the `UIKeyCommand` UIKit needs (verified
on iOS 27 with both the system keyboard and a third-party IME, and via a
synthesized long-press — no edit menu either), while some system surfaces
(Spotlight on iOS 27) do honour it and raise the iOS "Allow Paste" consent
alert, which appears in `describe-ui` and can be tapped like any other button.
Two more real-device caveats: **Universal Clipboard can shadow the staged
text** — on a device paired with a Mac, the consent alert may name the Mac and
the paste deliver the *Mac's* clipboard instead of what `paste` wrote — and
the field verification can come back unreadable on out-of-process surfaces.
Rather than claim success, `paste` verifies the field afterwards and exits
non-zero with an explanation if the text demonstrably did not land (an
unverifiable paste is reported as such, not as success); use
`--clipboard-only` when staging text deliberately, and `type` for anything the
keyboard can produce.

`keyboard-state` reports how it detected the keyboard. With a third-party
keyboard extension active it answers `soft (bounds unknown — out-of-process
keyboard extension)`: the keyboard is up, but an extension running in its own
process exposes no elements to read bounds from.

With that, every cross-platform verb works on real devices.


## Commands

All device-scoped commands accept `--device <ID>` (optional when only one simulator is booted). Three command layers:

  * **Top-level** — cross-platform verbs: `ui`, `tap`, `swipe`, `type`, `paste`, `button`, `gesture`, `keyboard-state`, `screenshot`, `record-video`, `app-state`. Same flags on iOS and Android.
  * **`sim-use ios <verb>`** — iOS-only: `key`, `key-combo`, `key-sequence`, `stream-video`, `batch`.
  * **`sim-use android <verb>`** — Android-only: `init`, `devices`, `ping`.
  * **`sim-use ios-device <verb>`** — real-device-only: `init`, `stop`, `status`, `devices`.

Run `sim-use --help` or `sim-use <command> --help` for the full flag set.

```bash
sim-use devices
UDID="B34FF305-5EA8-412B-943F-1D0371CA17FF"
```

### Touch & gestures

```bash
sim-use tap -x 100 -y 200 --device $UDID
sim-use tap --point 100,200 --device $UDID                    # same, pair form
sim-use tap @5 --device $UDID                                 # alias cache
sim-use tap "#3" --device $UDID                               # 3rd cell of the dominant list
sim-use tap "#2@2" --device $UDID                             # 2nd cell of the 2nd detected list
sim-use tap "#settingsButton" --device $UDID                  # AXUniqueId
sim-use tap --id Safari --device $UDID
sim-use tap --label "Safari" --device $UDID
sim-use tap --value "On" --device $UDID

sim-use swipe --from 100,300 --to 300,100 --device $UDID
sim-use swipe 100,300 300,100 --device $UDID
sim-use swipe --start-x 100 --start-y 300 --end-x 300 --end-y 100 --device $UDID
sim-use swipe --start-x 50 --start-y 500 --end-x 350 --end-y 500 --duration 2.0 --delta 25 --device $UDID

# Low-level touch control
sim-use touch -x 150 -y 250 --down --device $UDID
sim-use touch -x 150 -y 250 --up --device $UDID
sim-use touch -x 150 -y 250 --down --up --delay 1.0 --device $UDID   # long press

# Gesture presets
sim-use gesture scroll-up --device $UDID
sim-use gesture swipe-from-left-edge --device $UDID
sim-use gesture scroll-down --pre-delay 0.5 --post-delay 1.0 --device $UDID
```

`--pre-delay` / `--post-delay` / `--duration` work on `tap`, `swipe`, and `gesture` alike for coarse timing control.

### Text input

```bash
sim-use type 'Hello World!' --device $UDID
echo "complex text" | sim-use type --stdin --device $UDID
sim-use type --file input.txt --device $UDID
```

### Paste (IME-safe Unicode)

`sim-use paste` writes text to the simulator pasteboard (`simctl pbcopy`) and issues Cmd+V, so characters reach the focused field without going through the keyboard. This bypasses host IME composition (e.g. Japanese kana remapping ASCII keys) and accepts arbitrary Unicode the HID keycode table cannot express (CJK, emoji, diacritics).

```bash
sim-use paste 'ABC 日本語 🎉' --device $UDID             # at caret
sim-use paste 'new content' --replace --device $UDID   # Cmd+A + paste

printf '%s' "$CONTENT" | sim-use paste --stdin --device $UDID
sim-use paste --file body.txt --device $UDID
```

The default Cmd+V path needs a connected hardware keyboard on the simulator (Simulator.app: I/O > Keyboard > Connect Hardware Keyboard = ON). Under soft-keyboard-only mode HID Cmd+V is dropped — switch to `--via-menu`, which long-presses the target and taps the iOS edit-menu "Paste" button:

```bash
sim-use paste 'ABC 日本語' --via-menu --target-id chatTextField --device $UDID
sim-use paste 'NEW' --replace --via-menu --target-id chatTextField --device $UDID
sim-use paste 'at xy' --via-menu --target-x 171 --target-y 513 --device $UDID
```

iOS 16+ gates the first paste per app session behind an "Allow Paste" prompt (modal dialog on iOS 16, inline bubble on iOS 17+). sim-use does not auto-dismiss it — approve once interactively (iOS grants a ~60 s grace window for the session) or pre-configure Settings → Paste from Other Apps per app.

### Keyboard state

Probe whether the software keyboard is visible. Primary use: pick between the `paste` Cmd+V default and `--via-menu` path.

```bash
# Text form — prints `soft` or `hidden`. Both exit 0; non-zero is reserved
# for probe failure (unreachable device, AX fetch error). Branch on stdout.
if [[ "$(sim-use keyboard-state --device $UDID)" == soft ]]; then
  sim-use paste "$TEXT" --via-menu --target-id chatTextField --device $UDID
else
  sim-use paste "$TEXT" --device $UDID
fi

# JSON envelope — consume data.visible; the envelope may carry diagnostic
# counters alongside it for debugging false positives/negatives
sim-use keyboard-state --json --device $UDID
# -> {"ok":true,"data":{"visible":true, ...}}
```

### Hardware buttons

```bash
sim-use button home --device $UDID
sim-use button lock --duration 2.0 --device $UDID     # long press
sim-use button siri --device $UDID
# Also: side-button, apple-pay
```

### Low-level keyboard (iOS-only)

These verbs speak USB HID keycodes — they live under `sim-use ios <verb>`
because Android keyboard input goes through a different abstraction
(`KeyEvent.KEYCODE_*` via `INJECT_EVENTS`). For Android text entry use
`sim-use type` or `sim-use paste`.

```bash
# Individual key presses by HID keycode
sim-use ios key 40 --device $UDID                                     # Enter
sim-use ios key 42 --duration 1.0 --device $UDID                      # hold Backspace

# Sequences and modifier combos
sim-use ios key-sequence --keycodes 11,8,15,15,18 --device $UDID      # "hello"
sim-use ios key-combo --modifiers 227 --key 4 --device $UDID          # Cmd+A
sim-use ios key-combo --modifiers 227,225 --key 4 --device $UDID      # Cmd+Shift+A
```

### Batch chaining (iOS-only)

Run multiple steps in a single invocation. Batch reuses one HID session and one AX snapshot across steps, cutting round-trip cost on multi-step flows. iOS-only because the runner pins an iOS HID session across steps — Android steps each round-trip through the bridge already, so batching saves nothing there.

```bash
sim-use ios batch --device $UDID \
  --step "tap --id SearchField" \
  --step "type 'hello world'" \
  --step "key 40"

# With element waiting — selector taps poll until the element appears
sim-use ios batch --device $UDID \
  --wait-timeout 5 \
  --step "tap --id LoginButton" \
  --step "tap --id WelcomeMessage"

# From file (one step per line)
sim-use ios batch --device $UDID --file steps.txt
```

Key semantics:

- Exactly one step source per run: `--step`, `--file`, or `--stdin`.
- Fail-fast by default; `--continue-on-error` switches to best-effort.
- `--wait-timeout <seconds>` makes selector taps poll for the element to appear — primary mechanism for multi-screen flows.
- `--ax-cache perBatch` (default) reuses one AX snapshot for the whole run; `--ax-cache perStep` refreshes between steps when the UI changes; `--ax-cache none` disables snapshot reuse entirely. `--wait-timeout` polling always refetches.

### Screenshot

```bash
sim-use screenshot --device $UDID                                 # auto-named
sim-use screenshot --output ~/Desktop/shot.png --device $UDID     # specific file
sim-use screenshot --output ~/Desktop/ --device $UDID             # directory
```

The output path goes to stdout; progress messages go to stderr.

### Video streaming & recording

```bash
# MJPEG stream (iOS-only — no Android stream-video implementation)
sim-use ios stream-video --device $UDID --fps 10 --format mjpeg > stream.mjpeg

# Pipe into ffmpeg
sim-use ios stream-video --device $UDID --fps 30 --format ffmpeg | \
  ffmpeg -f image2pipe -framerate 30 -i - -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast out.mp4

# Record MP4 directly (cross-platform)
sim-use record-video --device $UDID --output recording.mp4            # 30 fps default
sim-use record-video --device $UDID --fps 60 --output smooth.mp4      # up to 60 fps
sim-use record-video --device $UDID --quality 60 --scale 0.5 --output low-bw.mp4
```

`record-video` captures a real H.264 stream and muxes it straight into the
MP4 (passthrough — no per-frame screenshot re-encoding):

  * **iOS** drives `FBSimulatorVideoStream` in eager H.264 mode at a constant
    `--fps` (default 30, max 60). Because the stream carries no timestamps,
    frames are laid out at exactly `1/fps`, so playback is smooth and the
    requested rate is honored.
  * **Android** pipes `adb screenrecord --output-format=h264` at the device's
    native variable frame rate, so `--fps` is ignored there; `--quality` maps
    to bitrate and `--scale` to `--size`. Recordings past the per-invocation
    limit on API < 34 are stitched across `screenrecord` restarts
    automatically.

Rotating the display mid-recording stops capture on Android (an MP4 track
can't change frame size). Press Ctrl+C to stop; sim-use finalises the MP4
before exiting.

### Accessibility inspection

```bash
sim-use ui --device $UDID                      # compact outline (default)
sim-use ui --json --device $UDID               # structured envelope
sim-use ui --json --no-raw --device $UDID      # envelope without the raw tree (much smaller)
sim-use ui --point 100,200 --device $UDID      # specific point (same UI space as outline frames)
```

The `--json` envelope carries the raw accessibility tree under `data.raw` by default; `--no-raw` drops it while keeping `outline` / `entries` / `lists` intact — prefer it in agent loops where the raw tree is only debugging ballast.

The outline uses region banding (`[Top]` / `[Content]` / `[Bottom]` / declared `Group` regions) and `@N` / `#N` / `#N@M` / `#<id>` alias addressing. When the device is rotated, the `App:` header carries an orientation tag (e.g. `(landscape-right)`) and the `--json` envelope an `orientation` field.

A list cluster detector runs on every snapshot and attaches `#N` aliases to detected list cells. Outline lines for cells render as `@N #M` (dominant list) or `@N #M@S` (scope `S>1`); the `--json` envelope adds a sibling `lists` array, ordered by detector score, where each entry summarises one cluster as `{ scope, cellCount, cellHeight, containerRole, containerLabel, bbox, score }`. Per-cell membership is also surfaced through `entries[*].aliases.list = { scope, index }` so consumers can pivot on either shape. `lists[0]` is always the dominant cluster, or the array is empty when nothing list-shaped is on screen.

### App state & crash detection

```bash
sim-use app-state --device $UDID                              # list running apps
sim-use app-state --bundle-id com.example.app --device $UDID  # running | not_running
sim-use app-state --reset --device $UDID                      # re-baseline crash detection
```

While the daemon drives a device, it watches for the target process disappearing between commands and surfaces a banner on the next `ui` call. The signal is process liveness (not foreground identity), so backgrounding for a permission dialog or share sheet never false-fires. On Android, `ui` also detects the AOSP system crash dialog directly from the accessibility tree. Call `app-state --reset` after an intentional relaunch; `SIM_USE_NO_CRASH_DETECT=1` disables detection entirely.

### Daemon

UDID-scoped commands auto-spawn a per-UDID background daemon on first use and reuse it on subsequent calls, amortising FBSimulatorControl / accessibility init (~200 ms per `ui`-shaped call). Scripts do not need to manage the daemon.

```bash
sim-use daemon status
sim-use daemon stop --device $UDID
sim-use daemon stop --all

# Force in-process execution for a single call (diagnostics)
SIM_USE_NO_DAEMON=1 sim-use ui --device $UDID
```

Daemons self-exit after 600 s of idle and log to `/tmp/sim-use-<uid>/<UDID>.log`. Streaming commands (`screenshot`, `record-video`, `stream-video`) always run in-process regardless.


## Architecture

sim-use drives iOS Simulators through the lower-level XCFrameworks of Facebook's [idb](https://github.com/facebook/idb), Apple's Accessibility APIs, and the simulator HID pipeline. Android devices are driven through an on-device bridge APK that exposes the AccessibilityService tree and input injection over HTTP, tunnelled via `adb forward`. Real iOS devices are driven through an on-device XCUITest bridge (`ios-bridge/`) that serves the same HTTP protocol over usbmux or TCP; because it emits the Simulator's accessibility-tree shape, the outline renderer and every selector are shared between the two iOS backends.

- **Single binary, single invocation.** No RPC daemon to manage manually; the optional per-UDID background daemon is auto-spawned and opt-out (`SIM_USE_NO_DAEMON=1`).
- **Agent-first output.** `ui` emits a compact outline with stable `@N` / `#<id>` aliases designed to round-trip between an LLM and the simulator with minimal token cost.
- **Full HID surface.** Tap, swipe, touch, gesture presets, hardware buttons, key combos, and IME-safe Unicode paste all exposed as first-class commands.
- **Scriptable from day one.** Every command supports `--json` for machine consumption; `batch` collapses multi-step flows into a single invocation.


## Viewer

A local web app that renders `sim-use ui --json` onto a scaled SVG canvas — see which elements the accessibility tree exposes, spot blind spots, and tap directly from the browser.

```bash
sim-use viewer
```
